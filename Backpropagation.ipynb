    "# Backpropagation Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll delve into the concept of backpropagation in neural networks. Backpropagation is a key algorithm for training neural networks, enabling them to learn from data by adjusting their weights and biases. We'll explore the implementation of backpropagation in the provided neural network code, understand how it computes gradients, and updates the network parameters to minimize the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Content\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Initialization\n",
    "We'll start by initializing the neural network with random weights and biases. We'll create an instance of the Network class with a specified architecture and random initialization for weights and biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Code snippet for initializing the neural network\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Feedforward Function\n",
    "Next, we'll review the feedforward method, which performs forward propagation through the network to compute the output. This method takes an input vector and passes it forward through each layer, applying the appropriate weights and biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Code snippet for the feedforward method\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Cost Function\n",
    "Before diving into backpropagation, we'll define the cost function used to measure the network's performance. We'll use the mean squared error (MSE) as our cost function.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Code snippet for the cost function (MSE)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Backpropagation Algorithm\n",
    "Now, we'll explore the backpropagation algorithm, which computes the gradients of the cost function with respect to the weights and biases of the network. We'll understand how errors are propagated backward through the network to update the parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Code snippet for the backpropagation algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Update Rule\n",
    "Finally, we'll implement the update rule to adjust the weights and biases of the network using the computed gradients and a learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Code snippet for the update rule\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Training Process\n",
    "We'll demonstrate the training process by applying backpropagation to a sample dataset. We'll iterate over the training data, compute gradients using backpropagation, and update the network parameters using stochastic gradient descent (SGD).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Code snippet for the training process\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Evaluation\n",
    "After training the network, we'll evaluate its performance on a test dataset to assess its accuracy and generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Code snippet for evaluating the network\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Backpropagation is a fundamental algorithm for training neural networks, enabling them to learn from data and make accurate predictions. In this notebook, we explored the implementation of backpropagation in the provided neural network code, understanding its role in optimizing network parameters and improving performance.\n",
