# Neural Network from Scratch

Welcome to my Neural Network from Scratch repository! ðŸš€ Here, I'm documenting my journey of learning neural networks from scratch using various resources. This repository contains notebooks where I delve into the fundamentals of neural networks, explaining concepts in detail from the ground up.

## About

As someone stepping into the world of machine learning, I found it crucial to understand the core concepts of neural networks thoroughly. In this repository, I aim to share my learning process with others who may be starting their journey or seeking to deepen their understanding.

## What's Inside?

- **Notebooks**: You'll find a collection of Jupyter notebooks where I break down various neural network concepts step by step. These notebooks include explanations, code snippets, and examples to illustrate the concepts effectively.

## Learning Resources

Throughout my journey, I've relied on a variety of learning resources. Here are some of the key ones:

- [Neural Network and Deep Learning book by Michael Nielsen](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html)
- [Neural Network series by 3Blue 1Brown on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi)
- [Understanding Backpropagation with example](https://mattmazur.com/2015/03/17/a-step-by-step-backpropagation-example/)

Feel free to explore these resources to dive deeper into neural networks and machine learning.

## Contribution
